Manifest: Empowering mental wellness. Articles, community support, and advocacy for self-care. Join us in the journey toward holistic well-being.

Amidst lockdowns and the digital age, humankind faced an inevitable decline in mental health levels. Our usual activities and routines were
abruptly disrupted for an extended period of time which has led to deteriorating mental health and increased suicidal behavior. During the
first year of COVID-19 pandemic, global pandemic of anxiety and depression increased by a massive 25% (World Health Organization [WHO], 2022). 

We need to take immediate action to combat the lingering impacts of lockdowns on our global community in terms of their mental health. This is the main goal of Manifest. This project offers expert-led introspection, counseling, and blogs to combat psychological challenges. Join our supportive community for sharing, learning, and growth. Access resources and solutions for mental wellness.
